Added option to disable auto-scroll.<br>

Added a basic check to see if a summary prompt exceeds max context size. Also added a more detailed error mesasge if API call fails with less than 10% free context remaining.

#### v1.0.4
Fixed an issue where Restore and Re-generate buttons would get a wrong message ID resulting in showing wrong original messages and trying to re-generate summary using wrong messages.<br>
Added a spinner and error checking for summary re-generation.<br>
Added some guards to prevent buttons being clicked again from triggering a generation action while one is already running.<br>
Increased `loading_order` value in the manifest. This extension doesn't really care about it, but this might be better for compatibility with other extensions.

#### v1.0.3
Chat will now attempt to scroll after reload to the summary message or the restored messages. (Note, can sometimes be unreliable as reloading chat triggers a scroll to the bottom and I'm tryingto scroll up, but should be better than nothing)<br>
